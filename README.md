# Python Homework Module 2 Challenge
In this assignment, you will create a Python script that analyzes the financial records of your company.  Inside your starter code, you will find a financial dataset in the budget_data.csv file. This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting, so the records are simple.)

*Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

*The total number of months included in the dataset

*The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period

*The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period

*The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

*The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
